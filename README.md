As the title of the repository states, this is a joke telling program. 
I got this source code from Al Sweigarts book "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python'.
As you read the code, this program was meant to practice working with print and input statements to create a small joke program. 
I have added several comments through throughout the program to annotate the different things that I had learned through typing this out. 
One piece that stood out to me from this program was integrating in a backslash in order to use an apostrophe within the print statement 
since I was using single quotes. 
This is a small program but I wanted to share what I worked on and learned today.
